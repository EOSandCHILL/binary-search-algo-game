About the Binary Search Algorithm Game application

I created the Binary Search Algorithm Game application to learn, practice, and sharpen my binary algorithm search skills. Iâ€™m a student currently pursuing my BS Degree in Software Development and a challenging class that I have requires me to thoroughly know algorithms. So, I utilized the Binary Search Algorithm Game application to practice consistently which allowed me to successfully pass the class!
